  abstract = {{We compare official population projections with Bayesian time series
	forecasts for England and Wales. The Bayesian approach allows the
	integration of uncertainty in the data, models and model parameters
	in a coherent and consistent manner. Bayesian methodology for time-series
	forecasting is introduced, including autoregressive (AR) and stochastic
	volatility (SV) models. These models are then fitted to a historical
	time series of data from 1841 to 2007 and used to predict future
	population totals to 2033. These results are compared to the most
	recent projections produced by the Office for National Statistics.
	Sensitivity analyses are then performed to test the effect of changes
	in the prior uncertainty for a single parameter. Finally, in-sample
	forecasts are compared with actual population and previous official
	projections. The article ends with some conclusions and recommendations
	for future work.}},

  title = {{WinBUGS - A Bayesian modelling framework: Concepts, structure, and
	extensibility}},

  volume = {10},
  pages = {325--337},

  month = oct,
  abstract = {{WinBUGS is a fully extensible modular framework for constructing
	and analysing Bayesian full probability models. Models may be specified
	either textually via the BUGS language or pictorially using a graphical
	interface called DoodleBUGS. WinBUGS processes the model specification
	and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. The
	software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu
	commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov
	chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why
	various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and
	run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss
	how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific
	applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS
	for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface
	with WinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that
	may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which
	they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require
	access to, or even recompilation of, the WinBUGS source-code.}},
